Usage
=====
The following examples demonstrate how the framework
can be used to model other systems. The first example
describes how the framework is set up, and how the 
model in the manuscript is designed. The second 
describes how the parameters for the model in the
paper can be easily modified programmatically to
generate simulations for a variety of scenarios.
The third and fourth examples show how a different reaction
systems can be modelled within the geometry of the HeLa
cell used in the manuscript.
